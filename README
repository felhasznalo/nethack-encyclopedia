IV. Contribute
-------------------------------
There are many tasks in the TODO document left TBD. Some are big,
some are small. Feel free to implement and then email me a patch
at mo@morsi.com (preferibly generating it with 'git am' and sending
it via 'git send-email').

All patch contributes agree to license their changes under the MIT
license. The author of every patch that gets added to the repo, no
matter how small, will get their name added to the authors list here,
and in the 'about' dialog in the app. I will periodically push
updates to the Nethack Encyclopedia on the Android Marketplace with
these updates.
